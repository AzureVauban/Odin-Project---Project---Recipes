    <p>This is my first webpage, it is just a collection of 2 recipes!
      The classic Turkey Salad which can be eaten by itself, with salted crackers such as RITZ,
      or even used with sliced bread to make a simple yet yummy sandwich!
      My next recipe is a Cranberry Sauce Muffin, a simple yet <strong> yummy</strong> food item
      those with an affinity for baking and a sweet tooth to go along with said affinity!
